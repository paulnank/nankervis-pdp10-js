# DECsystem-10 (PDP-10 KI10) diagnostics in Javascript 


This folder contains advanced material for debugging a PDP-10 CPU. Please ignore it unless you plan to do some serious debugging!

These are Javascript diagnotics for the DECsystem-10 (PDP-10 KI10) emulator at: [https://skn.noip.me/pdp10/pdp10.html](https://skn.noip.me/pdp10/pdp10.html)

The sources for the KI10 KLAD diagnostics can be found at [http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/klad_sources/index.html](http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/klad_sources/index.html). Javascript versions were produced from the related .sav files using a python script.

The KI10 specific materials for the PDP-10 CPU diagnostics all have the prefix DBK and they are in order of increasingly complex testing. So the first and simplest is dbkaa.*

More advanced diagnostics also require that diamon and subrtn are loaded before execution. This is done by editing pdp10.html to include the desired javascript files.

Most of the simpler diagnostics are able to be run under TOPS-10 as below...
